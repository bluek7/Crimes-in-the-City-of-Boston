# Crimes in the City of Boston

We will be analyzing data from the **Boston Police Department FIO (Field Interrogation and Observation) Study**, a large collection of data containing information about each individual occurence in which any person was interrogated by the Boston Police Department.

Many categories of information about the people that were interrogated is provided, such as their location and what clothing they wore are given. However, we are focusing on **sex, race, age, and the year in which the arrest occured** in this project, to analyze if there are differences between different demographics of people and how often they are interrogated.
